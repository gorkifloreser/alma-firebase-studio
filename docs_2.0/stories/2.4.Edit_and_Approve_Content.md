# Story 2.4: Edit and Approve Content

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to edit the AI-generated draft and approve it, **so that** I have final control over my message and can add my personal touch.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The generated content draft is displayed within a simple, intuitive editor ("The Artisan's Workshop").
2.  The user can modify the text of the draft.
3.  If bilingual, the user can easily switch between or see both language versions to edit them.
4.  An "Approve" button saves the content and marks its status as "Approved".
5.  Approved content is stored in the database, ready for scheduling in the next epic.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Content Editor UI (AC: 1, 2, 3)**
    - [x] Build the "Artisan's Workshop" UI, which includes text areas for editing the content.
    - [x] Implement a toggle or side-by-side view for bilingual editing.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Save and Approve Logic (AC: 4, 5)**
    - [x] Create a Supabase migration for the `content` table.
    - [x] Implement a server action that saves the edited content and sets its status to "Approved".

## Dev Notes
*   The `content` table should include columns for the content body (potentially a JSONB column for bilingual text), status, and a foreign key to the `offerings` table.
*   The editor should be user-friendly and provide a good writing experience.

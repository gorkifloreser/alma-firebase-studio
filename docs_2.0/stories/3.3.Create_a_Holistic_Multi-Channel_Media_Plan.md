# Story 3.3: Create a Holistic, Multi-Channel Media Plan

## Status: Pending

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want the AI to create a content plan that suggests specific pieces for social media, email, and WhatsApp, **so that** I have a clear, holistic strategy for promoting my "Offerings" across all my key channels.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Media Plan" page is created and is a protected route.
2.  A "Generate Plan" button triggers the AI to analyze all "Offerings" marked as "active".
3.  The AI generates a list of suggested content pieces for the upcoming week, explicitly tailored for different channels.
4.  The plan is displayed in a clear, organized list, grouped by channel.
5.  Each item in the plan can be clicked to initiate the content generation flow, pre-configured for the specified channel and format.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Create Media Plan Page (AC: 1, 4)**
    - [ ] Create a new protected route and page component at `src/app/media-plan`.
    - [ ] Design the UI to display the generated plan.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement AI Plan Generation (AC: 2, 3)**
    - [ ] Create a Backend Function to generate the media plan using the Gemini API.
    - [ ] The function should analyze active offerings and generate channel-specific content suggestions.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Content Generation Flow (AC: 5)**
    - [ ] Link each plan item to the content generation flow from Epic 2.

## Dev Notes
*   The prompt for the media plan generation should be carefully designed to produce a strategic and actionable plan.
*   The UI should make it easy for the user to understand and act on the suggestions.

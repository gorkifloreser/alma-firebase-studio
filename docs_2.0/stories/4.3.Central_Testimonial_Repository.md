## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want all my collected testimonials to be stored in one central place, **so that** I can easily find and reuse them in my marketing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A "Testimonials" tab is available within the "Harvest Circle" page.
2.  Testimonials received are stored in a central repository.
3.  Each testimonial can be tagged with the relevant "Offering".
4.  The user can easily view, search, and filter all their testimonials.

- [ ] **Task 1: Create Testimonials UI (AC: 1, 4)**
    - [ ] Add a "Testimonials" tab to the `src/app/harvest-circle` page.

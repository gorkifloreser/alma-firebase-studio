# Story 1.5: Define Brand Heart with Document Upload

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to be able to upload existing documents about my brand, **so that** the AI can analyze them to automatically understand my brand's essence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  On the "Brand Heart" page, there is an option to upload documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
2.  Uploaded files are securely stored using Supabase Storage.
3.  The user can see a list of their uploaded documents.
4.  (MVP) The system saves a reference to these documents for future analysis; full RAG processing will be implemented in a later story.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Implement File Upload UI (AC: 1)**
    - [x] Add a file input component to the "Brand Heart" page (`src/app/brand-heart`).
- [x] **Task 2: Implement File Storage Logic (AC: 2)**
    - [x] Create a server action to handle the file upload to Supabase Storage.
    - [x] Create a new table and migration (`brand_documents`) to store references to the uploaded files, linking them to the user.
- [x] **Task 3: Display Uploaded Documents (AC: 3)**
    - [x] Fetch and display the list of uploaded documents for the user on the "Brand Heart" page.

## Dev Notes
*   This story is the first step for the RAG system. The actual analysis of the documents is out of scope for this story.
*   Implement security rules on the Supabase Storage bucket to ensure users can only access and upload to their own designated folders.

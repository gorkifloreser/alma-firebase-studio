# Story 4.4: Reseed Content with Testimonials

## Status: Pending

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to be able to turn a powerful testimonial into new marketing content with one click, **so that** I can "reseed" my marketing with authentic stories of transformation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  In the testimonial repository, each testimonial has a "Create Content from this" button.
2.  Clicking this button sends the testimonial text to the "Creative Studio" (Module 5).
3.  The AI generates a new draft social media post that features the testimonial, framed by the user's Brand Heart.
4.  The new draft appears in the "Artisan's Workshop" (Module 6) for the user to edit and approve.

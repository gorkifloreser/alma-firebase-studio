# Story 3.2: View and Edit the Landing Page

## Status: Pending

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to view and edit the AI-generated landing page in a simple visual editor, **so that** I can ensure it perfectly represents my "Offering".

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The generated landing page is displayed in a simple, visual drag-and-drop editor.
2.  The user can edit the text content and reorder pre-defined content blocks (e.g., Header, Body, CTA).
3.  The landing page includes the configured CTA (email capture form or WhatsApp button).
4.  The user can save their changes.
5.  A unique, shareable URL is generated for the landing page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Integrate Visual Editor (AC: 1)**
    - [ ] Integrate the Puck open-source library into the application.
    - [ ] Create a new page component at `src/app/funnels/[id]/edit` to host the editor.
- [ ] **Task 2: Create Custom Components (AC: 2)**
    - [ ] Develop a set of custom, Tailwind CSS-styled React components for use within the Puck editor.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Save and URL Generation (AC: 4, 5)**
    - [ ] Implement the logic to save the edited landing page content.
    - [ ] Generate a unique, shareable URL for the page.

## Dev Notes
*   Refer to the Puck documentation for integration best practices.
*   The custom components should be designed to be flexible and reusable.

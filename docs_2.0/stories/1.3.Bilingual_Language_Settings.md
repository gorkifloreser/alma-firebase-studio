# Story 1.3: Bilingual Language Settings

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to set a primary and an optional secondary language for my brand, **so that** the platform can generate content in the languages my audience speaks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  Within a dedicated "Account Settings" page, the user can select a primary language from a predefined list.
2.  The user can optionally select a secondary language from the same list.
3.  The selected language preferences are saved to the user's profile.
4.  The UI for language selection is clear and easy to use.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Account Settings Page (AC: 1, 2, 4)**
    - [x] Create a new protected route and page component at `src/app/settings/account`.
    - [x] Design a UI for selecting primary and secondary languages (e.g., dropdowns).
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Language Preference Logic (AC: 3)**
    - [x] Create a server action to update the user's profile in Supabase with their language preferences.
    - [x] Fetch and display the user's current language preferences on the settings page.
- [x] **Task 3: Populate Language List**
    - [x] Create a predefined list of supported languages in a utility file (e.g., `src/lib/languages.ts`).

## Dev Notes
*   The user's language preferences should be stored in the `profiles` table.
*   Ensure the form submission for language settings provides clear feedback to the user (e.g., success or error message).

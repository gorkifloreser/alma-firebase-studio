# Story 3.4: Schedule Approved Content on the Cosmic Calendar

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to see all my approved content on a calendar and schedule it for publication, **so that** I have peace of mind that my marketing is automated.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Calendar" page is created and is a protected route.
2.  All content with an "Approved" status appears in an "Unscheduled" sidebar.
3.  The user can drag and drop content from the sidebar onto the calendar to set a publication date and time.
4.  Once scheduled, the content's status changes to "Scheduled" and it is displayed on the calendar.
5.  (MVP) The "publication" itself is a placeholder for now. Direct social media integration will be a future story.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Calendar Page (AC: 1, 2)**
    - [x] Create a new protected route and page component at `src/app/calendar`.
    - [x] Implement a calendar view and a sidebar for unscheduled content.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Drag-and-Drop Scheduling (AC: 3, 4)**
    - [x] Use a library like `react-beautiful-dnd` or similar to implement the drag-and-drop functionality.
    - [x] Implement the server action to update the content's status and scheduled time.

## Dev Notes
*   The "publication" is a placeholder. The focus is on the scheduling UI and state management.
*   Ensure the calendar view is intuitive and provides a good user experience.

# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Initial Setup

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a developer,** I want a simple Next.js application and a Supabase project set up, **so that** I have a solid foundation to build the application on.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A Next.js application is created (e.g., `npx create-next-app`).
2.  A `supabase` directory is created at the root to hold Edge Functions and migrations.
3.  The Supabase client is integrated into the Next.js application.
4.  A basic CI pipeline using GitHub Actions is configured to run linting and build checks.
5.  Initial Supabase migration for the `profiles` table is created.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Initialize Next.js Application (AC: 1)**
    - [x] Use `npx create-next-app@latest` to create a new Next.js application.
    - [x] Ensure the application is set up with TypeScript and the `src` directory.
- [x] **Task 2: Initialize Supabase Project (AC: 2)**
    - [x] Create a `supabase` directory at the project root.
    - [x] Initialize a new Supabase project within this directory.
- [x] **Task 3: Create Initial Database Migration (AC: 5)**
    - [x] Create a new Supabase migration file.
    - [x] Add the SQL schema for the `profiles` table, linking it to `auth.users`.
- [x] **Task 4: Integrate Supabase Client (AC: 3)**
    - [x] Add the `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency.
    - [x] Create a Supabase client instance in `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`.
    - [x] Use environment variables for the Supabase URL and anon key.
- [x] **Task 5: Configure Basic CI Pipeline (AC: 4)**
    - [x] Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.
    - [x] Configure the workflow to run on push and pull requests.
    - [x] Add jobs for installing dependencies, linting, and building the Next.js application.

## Dev Notes
*   This is a standard Next.js project. Code should be located within the `src` directory.
*   The database schema is managed by Supabase migrations.
*   Refer to the `docs_2.0/architecture` for detailed technical specifications.

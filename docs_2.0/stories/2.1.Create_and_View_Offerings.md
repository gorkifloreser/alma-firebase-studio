# Story 2.1: Create and View Offerings

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to add my products, services, or events to a catalog, **so that** the platform knows what I am offering to my audience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Offerings" page is created and is a protected route.
2.  The user can create a new "Offering" by filling out a form with fields for Title, Description, and Type (e.g., Product, Service, Event).
3.  If a secondary language is configured, the form displays fields for both languages.
4.  An "Auto-translate" button is available to translate the Title and Description from the primary to the secondary language, with the output being editable.
5.  All created "Offerings" are displayed in a clean, gallery-like list on the "Offerings" page.
6.  The user can click on an "Offering" to view its details.

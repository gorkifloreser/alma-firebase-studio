# Story 4.1: Track Offering Delivery

## Status: Pending

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want a simple dashboard to track the delivery status of my "Offerings", **so that** I can manage my post-sale workflow and know when to engage with my customers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Harvest Circle" page is created and is a protected route.
2.  The page displays a list of recent sales/engagements.
3.  Each item has a status (e.g., "To Deliver," "In Progress," "Completed").
4.  The user can manually update the status of each item.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Create Harvest Circle Page (AC: 1, 2)**
    - [ ] Create the new protected route and page component at `src/app/harvest-circle`.
    - [ ] Implement the UI to display a list of sales/engagements.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Status Tracking Logic (AC: 3, 4)**
    - [ ] Create a Supabase migration for a `sales` or `engagements` table with a status column.
    - [ ] Implement the server action to update the status of an item.

## Dev Notes
*   This feature is foundational for the rest of the epic. Ensure the data model is robust enough to support future automation.

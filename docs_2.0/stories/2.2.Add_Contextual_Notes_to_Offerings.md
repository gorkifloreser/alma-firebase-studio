# Story 2.2: Add Contextual Notes to Offerings

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to add special notes to my "Offerings", **so that** the AI can understand the specific context for a marketing campaign (e.g., "pre-sale discount," "for beginners," "limited spots").

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  When creating or editing an "Offering", there is a dedicated field for "Contextual Notes".
2.  The user can add free-text notes to this field.
3.  These notes are saved and associated with the specific "Offering".
4.  The notes are clearly visible when viewing the details of an "Offering".

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Update Offering Form (AC: 1)**
    - [x] Add a "Contextual Notes" textarea to the offering form component.
- [x] **Task 2: Update Database and Save Logic (AC: 2, 3)**
    - [x] Create a Supabase migration to add a `contextual_notes` column to the `offerings` table.
    - [x] Update the server action to save the contextual notes.
- [x] **Task 3: Display Contextual Notes (AC: 4)**
    - [x] Update the offering detail view to display the saved notes.

## Dev Notes
*   This is an extension of the previous story. Ensure the changes are integrated smoothly with the existing "Offerings" feature.

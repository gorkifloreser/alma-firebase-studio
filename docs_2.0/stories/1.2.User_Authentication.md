# Story 1.2: User Authentication

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to be able to sign up and log in to the platform, **so that** I can access my private brand workspace.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A user can sign up for a new account using an email and password via a clean, simple interface.
2.  A user can log in with their credentials.
3.  A user can log out.
4.  The application has protected routes that are only accessible after a user has logged in.
5.  Authentication is securely handled using Supabase Auth.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Authentication UI (AC: 1, 2, 3)**
    - [x] Create a sign-up page component in `src/app/signup`.
    - [x] Create a login page component in `src/app/login`.
    - [x] Create a logout button component in `src/components/auth`.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Authentication Logic (AC: 1, 2, 3, 5)**
    - [x] Implement sign-up functionality using the Supabase client.
    - [x] Implement login functionality using the Supabase client.
    - [x] Implement logout functionality.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Protected Routes (AC: 4)**
    - [x] Use Next.js middleware to protect routes based on authentication state.
    - [x] Redirect unauthenticated users from protected routes to the login page.

## Dev Notes

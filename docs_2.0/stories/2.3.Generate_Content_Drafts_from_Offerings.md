# Story 2.3: Generate Content Drafts from Offerings

## Status: Pending

## Story
**As a Conscious Creator,** I want to select one of my "Offerings" and have the AI generate a social media post for it, **so that** I can quickly create marketing content that is aligned with my brand.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  On the detail page for a specific "Offering", there is a "Generate Content" button.
2.  Upon clicking, the AI uses the Brand Heart (from Module 1) and the selected "Offering" details (including contextual notes) to generate a draft social media post.
3.  If two languages are configured, the AI generates the post in both languages.
4.  The generated draft is displayed to the user for review in a modal or a new view.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Implement "Generate Content" Feature (AC: 1, 2)**
    - [ ] Add the "Generate Content" button to the offering detail page.
    - [ ] Create a Supabase Edge Function to handle the content generation request.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement AI Content Generation (AC: 2, 3)**
    - [ ] The Edge Function will gather the Brand Heart and Offering data.
    - [ ] It will then call the Gemini API with a structured prompt to generate the social media post.
    - [ ] Ensure the function handles bilingual generation.
- [ ] **Task 3: Display Generated Content (AC: 4)**
    - [ ] Create a modal or a new page component to display the generated draft to the user.

## Dev Notes
*   The quality of the generated content heavily depends on the prompt. Craft a detailed prompt that includes the Brand Heart, offering details, and contextual notes.
*   Provide clear loading and error states for the user during the generation process.

### Step 1: Defining Your Brand Heart

This is the first and most crucial step. Here, you will define your brand's identity and voice. All future communication and content will be based on this foundation.

1.  **Navigation:** On the sidebar menu, click on the **"Brand Heart"** section.
2.  **Action:** You will see a guided form with several sections (Mission, Vision, Values, Tone of Voice, etc.).
3.  **Fill in the fields:** Take your time to complete each field with your brand's information. Be as detailed as possible.
4.  **Upload your logo:** Look for the designated button or area to upload your brand's logo.
5.  **Save:** Once you have completed all the information, find a **"Save"** or **"Update"** button to store your brand settings.

> **Note:** There might also be an option to define your Brand Heart by uploading documents. If you prefer this method, look for a tab or button that says **"Upload Document"**.

### Step 2: Creating Your Offerings

Once your brand is defined, the next step is to create the products, services, or experiences you provide to your audience.

1.  **Navigation:** On the sidebar, click on the **"Offerings"** section.
2.  **Action:** You will see a main dashboard, likely with a visible button to **"Create New Offering"** or a `+` icon. Click it.
3.  **Fill out the form:**
    *   **Title and Description:** Give your offering a clear name and an attractive description.
    *   **Offering Type:** Select the type of offering (product, service, event, etc.) from a dropdown list.
    *   **Contextual Notes:** Add any additional details that are relevant for creating content about this offering.
4.  **Save:** Click the **"Create"** or **"Save Offering"** button to add it to your list.
5.  **Repeat:** Create as many offerings as you need.

### Step 3: Generating Funnels and Strategies

With your offerings created, you can now generate a "Magic Funnel," which is a marketing strategy and sales funnel designed for a specific offering.

1.  **Navigation:** Go to the **"Funnels"** section in the sidebar.
2.  **Action:** Click the **"Generate Magic Funnel"** or **"Create Funnel"** button.
3.  **Select an Offering:** You will be prompted to choose which of your "Offerings" you want to create the funnel for. Select it from the list.
4.  **Define the Goal:** Specify the main objective of this funnel (e.g., sales, lead generation, brand awareness).
5.  **Generate:** Click the **"Generate"** button. The AI will create a strategy and the funnel steps, which may include a Landing Page.
6.  **Review and Edit:** Once generated, you can view the funnel details. Look for options to **"View Landing Page"** or **"Edit Steps"** if you need to make adjustments.

### Step 4: Building the Campaign

The funnel defines the strategy; the campaign turns that strategy into concrete content for your channels.

1.  **Navigation:** Click on **"Campaign Orchestrator"** in the sidebar.
2.  **Action:** You will likely see an option to **"Create Campaign"** or be asked to select the "Funnel" for which you want to generate the campaign.
3.  **Select the Funnel:** Choose the funnel you created in the previous step.
4.  **Generate:** Click **"Generate Campaign"**. The application will create a series of content drafts (social media posts, emails, etc.) tailored to each stage of the funnel and your channels.
5.  **Review and Approve:**
    *   Navigate through the generated content pieces.
    *   Click on each one to **"Edit"** the text, images, or creative prompts.
    *   When a piece of content is ready, look for a button or switch to **"Approve"** it.

### Step 5: Customizing Content in AI Artisan

This is your creative studio for refining and personalizing the content drafts generated by the Campaign Orchestrator before they are scheduled.

1.  **Navigation:** Go to the **"AI Artisan"** section. Here you will find the content items you approved in the previous step.
2.  **Select Content:** Click on a content item to open an advanced editor.
3.  **Customize:** Use the AI tools to:
    *   **Tweak the copy:** Change the tone, shorten or lengthen the text.
    *   **Generate visuals:** Create or modify images for the post.
    *   **Finalize details:** Add hashtags, mentions, or any other final touches.
4.  **Schedule:** Once a piece of content is fully customized and ready, look for a **"Schedule"** button to send it to the Cosmic Calendar.

### Step 6: Scheduling on the Cosmic Calendar

This is where everything comes to life. The calendar allows you to visualize and manage when your approved and customized content will be published.

1.  **Navigation:** Go to the **"Calendar"** section in the sidebar.
2.  **View:** You will see a calendar view (monthly, weekly, or daily).
3.  **Scheduled Content:** The content you finalized in "AI Artisan" will appear on the dates you selected.

    *   **Edit:** Click on a calendar item to open its details and make last-minute edits.
5.  **Publication:** Depending on your integrations, the content will be published automatically at the scheduled date and time.

### Step 7: The Harvest Circle (Testimonials)

After your offerings have been delivered, the Harvest Circle helps you gather and utilize social proof to fuel future marketing.

1.  **Navigation:** Click on **"Harvest Circle"** in the sidebar.
2.  **Track Delivery:** This section may show the status of your offerings to identify customers from whom you can request testimonials.
3.  **Request Testimonials:** Look for a feature to **"Automate Testimonial Requests"**. This will likely send emails or messages to past clients.
4.  **Central Repository:** All collected testimonials will appear in a central library. You can review, manage, and tag them here.
5.  **Reseed Content:** Use a feature like **"Reseed Content with Testimonials"** to instruct the AI to incorporate this powerful social proof into new marketing materials, thus closing the loop.
